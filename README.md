# YOLO Object Detection in Google Colab

This repository contains the implementation of a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection using Google Colab.

## 📝 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to implement and use the YOLO model to detect objects in images. The code was developed in Google Colab to facilitate access to GPU resources and simplify environment setup.
